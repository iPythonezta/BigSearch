            "text": "The value of adjunctive immunomodulatory therapies in treating severe influenza and other respiratory viral infections remains uncertain. Although often used, systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of mortality and morbidity (e.g. secondary infections) in severe influenza and other viral infections, especially if there is delay or lack of effective antiviral therapy. Non-randomized studies suggest that convalescent plasma appears useful as add-on therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza A(H5N1), and influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic [A(H1N1)pdm09), but it is limited by its availability. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing hyperimmune globulin prepared from convalescent plasma against normal intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) manufactured before 2009 as control in patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection on standard antiviral treatment has shown that the hyperimmune globulin group who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset had a lower viral load and reduced mortality compared with the controls. A number of agents with immunomodulatory effects (e.g. acute use of statins, N-acetylcysteine, macrolides, PPAR agonists, IVIG, celecoxib, mesalazine) have been proposed for influenza management. However, more animal and detailed human observational studies and preferably RCTs controlling for the effects of antiviral therapy and disease severity are needed for evaluating these agents. The role of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion as rescue therapy also merits more investigation.",

            "text": "Respiratory failure is the major complication in patients hospitalized with severe viral infections such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the novel coronavirus (CoV) infection. Affected patients may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. [1] [2] [3] [4] Excessive cytokine and chemokine responses have been proposed as central to disease pathogenesis and end-organ damage in such patients. 2, 4 Dysregulated responses with marked elevations of blood IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL9/ MIG have been observed in patients infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus; these responses are correlated with high levels of viral replication in the respiratory tract. 2, 5 Higher plasma levels of proinflammatory IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, and sTNFR-1 have been observed in patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection than those with mild disease, and the levels correlate with the extent and progression of pneumonia. 6, 7 While neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) therapy is useful in improving clinical outcome if administered to patients hospitalized with influenza within 4-5 days of illness onset, there is often delay in initiation of NAI therapy and progressive disease sometimes occurs despite early administration. 8 In SARS, there were marked increases in Th1 cytokine interferon (IFN)-c, inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12, and chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10, and these changes confirmed the activation of Th1 cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and hyperinnate inflammatory response through the accumulation of monocytes/ macrophages and neutrophils. 9 This article reviews the potential role of adjunctive therapies and immunomodulating agents in the management of patients hospitalized with severe influenza and other acute respiratory viral infections. Although we focus on clinical reports, animal model studies of relevance are also highlighted.",

In a prospective observational study assessing the viral loads and duration of viral shedding in adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza A(H3N2), administration of systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of either asthma or COPD was found to be an independent risk factor associated with prolonged viral shedding beyond 1 week of illness onset. 12 In a retrospective review conducted at a national hospital in Japan where patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 generally received NAI within 2 days from illness onset, the administration of systemic corticosteroids for pneumonia with acute wheezing was not associated with worse outcome when compared to those who did not receive steroid. 13 However, many observational studies have shown that early use of systemic corticosteroids therapy, especially in the absence of NAI therapy or those with NAI initiation beyond 3-4 days of illness onset, was associated with an increased risk of death, increased rate of nosocomial pneumonia, or increased risk of developing critical disease in patients hospitalized with A(H1N1)pdm09-associated pneumonia and/or ARDS, [14] [15] [16] [17] whereas other studies have shown no survival advantage when comparing ICU patients with and without addition of systemic corticosteroids therapy 18, 19 (Table 1) .",

[29] [30] [31] [32] These experiences caution against the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe viral pneumonia.

All six different IVIG preparations tested had significant levels of cross-reactive-specific antibody at a concentration of 2Á0 g/dl of immunoglobulin, whereas sera from 18 of 19 Kawasaki disease patients had significant increases of cross-reactive-specific antibody after receiving 2Á0 g/kg of pre-pandemic IVIG. 45 IVIG was administered to a patient with ARDS due to A (H1N1)pdm09 with favorable response, but interpretation of data was limited by concomitant use of high-dose oseltamivir. 46 Significant neutralizing activities against influenza A (H2N2) viruses have been observed in human IVIG lots manufactured from 1993 to 2010 in Japan. 47 In aggregate, these observations suggest that evaluation of specific neutralizing antibody titers may provide useful information about IVIGs as potential therapeutics and raise the possibility of using IVIG therapy for severe and/or drugresistant influenza virus infections especially in the immunocompromised. [45] [46] [47] It is important to note that IVIG may increase blood viscosity and hence, the risk of thromboembolic diseases, as it has occurred during treatment of SARS despite the use of prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin. [48] [49] [50] Statins Statins have some anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects (e.g. by repressing induction of MHC-II by IFN-c and subsequent T-lymphocyte activation) and a potential role has been proposed for treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic influenza based on observational studies showing the survival benefits in patients receiving statins who developed bacteremia, sepsis, or CAP. 51 However, in a murine model of influenza A infection, the administration of rosuvastatin had no effect on viral clearance of influenza A after infection, and mortality was unaffected. 52 In a study of BALB/c mice treated with several types of statins intraperitoneally or orally at various concentrations before or after infection with influenza A/Duck/MN/1525/81 (H5N1) virus, influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) virus, influenza A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) virus, influenza A/NWS/ 33 (H1N1) virus or influenza A/CA/04/09 H1N1pdm09 virus, there was no improvement of survival when comparing mice that had received different types of statins at various doses with untreated controls. 53 A population-based cohort study over 10 influenza seasons (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) in Ontario, Canada, with propensitybased matching has shown small protective effects of chronic use of statins against pneumonia hospitalization ([OR] 0Á92; 95% CI 0Á89-0Á95), 30-day pneumonia mortality (0Á84; 95% CI 0Á77-0Á91), and all-cause mortality (0Á87; 95% CI 0Á84-0Á89). Furthermore, these protective effects attenuated substantially after multivariate adjustment and when excluding multiple observations for each individual, declined over time, differed across propensity score quintiles and risk groups, and were unchanged during post-influenza season periods. 54 In a retrospective case-control study using the UK Influenza Clinical Information Network database on 1,520 patients hospitalized with confirmed influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 infection between Apr 2009 and Jan 2010, no statistically significant association between pre-admission statin use and severity of outcome was found in those aged 35 years or above [adjusted OR: 0Á81 (95% CI: 0Á46-1Á38); n = 571]. After adjustment for age, sex, obesity, and indication for statin, the association between pre-admission statin use and severe outcome was not statistically significant. 55 Immunomodulation for severe viral illness ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd",

Moreover, readmission to hospital within 6 months after discharge was significantly lower in the clarithromycin group. 58 Clarithromycin has been shown to reduce viral titers and cytokines in supernatant fluids, viral RNA in the cells, and the susceptibility to virus infection in cultured human tracheal epithelial cells infected with influenza A (H3N2) virus. In addition, it can reduce expression of sialic acid a2, 6 Gal on human tracheal mucosal surface, and the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes in the cells from which viral RNPs enter into the cytoplasm. 59 In an observational study assessing a mixed bag of immunomodulating agents (macrolides, systemic corticosteroids, and statins) on the development of severe disease in hospitalized adults with A(H1N1)pdm09, none of these therapies was found to be associated with a lower risk of developing severe disease. 60 In a RCT of young patients with mild seasonal influenza A infection who had received early NAI therapy in Japan, the addition of clarithromycin did not result in better outcome other than a shorter duration of cough in patients without cough at the onset of pyrexia. 61 In a prospective, observational, multicenter study of 733 patients with primary viral pneumonia due to A(H1N1) pdm09 conducted across 148 ICUs in Spain, macrolide-based treatment (n = 190) was not associated with improved survival in critically ill A(H1N1)pdm09 patients with primary viral pneumonia. 62 A recent Tennessee Medicaid cohort study found that 5 days of azithromycin therapy were associated with a small absolute increase in cardiovascular deaths, especially among patients with a high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease. 63 Nevertheless, more data are needed on the role of macrolides in patients hospitalized with severe influenza to judge its potential value.",

Gemfibrozil was administered intraperitoneally once daily from days 4 to 10 after intranasal exposure to the virus and survival increased from 26% in vehicle-treated mice (n = 50) to 52% in mice given gemfibrozil at 60 mg/kg/day (n = 46) (P = 0Á003). 64 In a study examining the impact of systemic corticosteroid (dexamethasone) and the PPAR-c agonist (pioglitazone) on the outcome of infection in smoke-exposed mice, C57BL/6 mice were exposed to room air or cigarette smoke for 4 days and then inoculated with an H1N1 virus (to mimic influenza and COPD). Smoke-exposed mice were shown to have an exacerbated inflammatory response following infection. Dexamethasone reduced mononuclear cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of smoke-exposed, virally infected mice, whereas pioglitazone reduced mononuclear cells and neutrophils in the BAL and increased peripheral CD4 and CD8 cells. 65 In a study of mice challenged with virulent influenza A viruses including avian A(H5N1) strains, an increased accumulation of dendritic cell (DC) subset known as the TNF/iNOS-producing (tip) DCs was observed in the airways of mice with pneumonia. The study found that treatment with pioglitazone reduced tipDC trafficking, and suggested that this might moderate the potentially lethal consequences of excessive tipDC recruitment, without abrogating CD8 + T-cell expansion or compromising virus control, 66 Aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) is an activator of AMPK, which is known as a stimulator of PPARs and can complement the action of immunosuppression by pharmacological PPAR agonists. 67 In mice infected with the mouse-adapted influenzaA/Puerto Rico/8/31 (PR8) (H1N1) virus, rosiglitazone treatment provided absolute protection from death, whereas the mice treated with pioglitazone displayed a 20% increase in survival over control animals. AICAR alone provided a 40% increase in protection, whereas the AICAR/pioglitazone combination increased survival by 60%. The results suggest that there is an additive benefit of using the two drugs in combination. 68 These studies suggest that the role of PPAR-c agonists should be further explored in managing severe viral exacerbations.",

In addition, significantly higher levels of CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes and less pulmonary inflammation were found in the group receiving triple therapy. Mesalazine inhibits lipoxygenase and COX pathways, which can lead to reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids and therefore reduced activation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. Mesalazine also inhibits NF-KB activation and promote synthesis of phosphatidic acid (thus inhibit the stimulatory effects of ceramides on apoptosis). 72 More clinical studies are needed on the therapeutic role of these two agents with immunomodulating properties in severe influenza and other viral infections.",

Evaluation of specific neutralizing antibody titers in IVIGs for severe and/or drugresistant influenza virus infections is needed especially in the immunocompromised. Systemic corticosteroids should not be used routinely in severe viral infection such as influenza as it may increase the risk of mortality and morbidity (e.g. secondary infections), especially when there is delay or lack of effective antiviral therapy. It is worthwhile to explore the immunomodulating efficacy of NAC, macrolide, acute use of statins, PPAR agonists AE AMPK, and celecoxib AE mesalazine with more animal and detailed human observational studies and preferably RCTs.
